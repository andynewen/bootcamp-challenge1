# Bootcamp Challenge 1

Bootcamp Week 1 Challenge that was assigned to us.

## Description

This weeks challenge was to refactor existing code(improving it without changing what it does). Changing most of the HTML code with less repetitive code, and combining selectors together to make it easier to change in the future.
